Insurance Claims Fraud Detection Model

TODO: Implement the fraud detection model according to the requirements:
1. Load and explore the claims dataset
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, feature scaling)
3. Train multiple models (at least 2 different algorithms)
4. Evaluate and compare using precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Select the best model and explain your choice

Success Criteria:
- Achieve precision > 0.75 (reduce false positives)
- Maintain recall > 0.60 (still catch fraud)
- Clear model comparison with business impact explanation
